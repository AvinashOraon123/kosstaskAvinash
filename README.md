3.Approach:
Managing this task along with academics and tests was a difficult job.

  2.I saw some javascript tutorials from codewithharry.
  3. I did research on how to use reddit what are subreddits,also how to use GitHub to upload files.I made a plan that I'll be using tech stack of html-css-javascript.
